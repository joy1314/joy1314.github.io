# About Me

<img src="/images/jasonansel4.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="300">
My name is Jing Xu (Joy).  I am a master student under the supervision of 
Prof. Han Zhang in [Nankai University], [Data intelligence laboratory],. 
I am interested in developing tools for biological sequences classification 
or annotation. Before that, I got my Bachelor degree in automation in 
[Nankai University].

I did my Ph.D. dissertation in the [Commit] group lead by  [Saman Amarasinghe].
I started the [OpenTuner] project, an extensible framework for program
autotuning.  I also created the [PetaBricks] programming language, a language
that incorporates algorithmic choices to allow an integrated autotuner to
explore search spaces of program implementations.  As an undergraduate, I did
research with [Gene Cooperman] and helped create [DMTCP], a user-level
distributed checkpoint/restart system.
