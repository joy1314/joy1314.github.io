## Research Projects

### [eCAMI]
[eCAMI] is a Python package for CAZyme classification, motif identification, and genome annotation, which is based on a bipartite network algorithm.


### [APIN]
[APIN] is a Python tool for antimicrobial peptide sequences identification. It is based on a deep learning structure named "multi-scale convolutional network" which contains multiple convolutional layers of various filter lengths. Therefore, it could utilize all latent features captured by the multiple convolutional layers. Besides, redundant information is incporporated into this structure to further improve the performance.


### ECGUFS
ECGUFS is an ensemble method based on consensus-guided unsupervised feature selection (CGUFS) in order to further improve the
accuracy and the stability of disease-associated genes identification.
